<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deflectometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Falling Weight Deflectometer</li><li>Light Weight Deflectometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The deflectometer market is primarily segmented into two types: Falling Weight Deflectometers (FWD) and Light Weight Deflectometers (LWD). FWDs evaluate pavement stiffness by measuring deflection under a falling weight, providing insights into pavement structural capacity for heavy traffic. In contrast, LWDs are portable and assess surface characteristics using a lighter load, making them ideal for quick inspections and maintenance assessments. Both types are essential for infrastructure evaluation and ensure the longevity and safety of roadways and pavements.</p></p>
