<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Die Casting Machinery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Chamber Die Casting Machine</li><li>Cold Chamber Die Casting Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The die casting machinery market includes two primary types: hot chamber and cold chamber die casting machines. Hot chamber machines utilize a molten metal reservoir and inject it into the mold under high pressure, suitable for metals with low melting points, such as zinc and lead. Cold chamber machines, on the other hand, require the metal to be melted in a separate furnace before being injected, accommodating higher melting point metals like aluminum and magnesium. Each type serves specific industrial applications based on material properties.</p></p>
